# This file is *only* used when running `terraform plan` locally with the CLI. It prevents uploading the majority
# of excess files, including node_modules directories, to Terraform Cloud to execute the plan. When running in
# Terraform Cloud from a Git update, the entire repo will still be cloned.

# Diagnose issues with this file with `TF_IGNORE=trace terraform plan`

# It feels like fewer negated paths works more quickly, but removing node_modules directories (see terraform/README.md) makes
# the biggest difference. Leaving the more granular exclude paths to better align with the Terraform Cloud workspace
# triggers config, and to require terraform/* files and folders to opt in.

# Ignore everything by default
*

# Only allow directories with files actually needed by Terraform.
!/terraform

# This appears to happen by default unless you use negatived paths like above(?). Regardless,
# it makes a significant difference.
/terraform/**/.terraform/
